# WordPress MCP

Connect OpenClaw to any WordPress site running the Immens MCP Fortress plugin. This gives your AI agent access to 274+ WordPress management tools.

## Prerequisites

1. A WordPress site with [Immens MCP Fortress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/immens-mcp-fortress/) installed and activated
2. At least one Access Point configured with an API key (go to **MCP Fortress → Access Points** in WordPress admin)

## Configuration

Add the MCP server to your OpenClaw config:

```bash
openclaw mcp add immens-mcp-fortress \
  --url "https://YOUR_SITE.com/wp-json/immens-mcp-fortress/v1/mcp" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE.com` with your WordPress site URL and `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key from your Access Point.

## Auto-Discovery

If your WordPress site has Immens MCP Fortress v1.1.1+, OpenClaw can auto-discover the server via:

```
https://YOUR_SITE.com/.well-known/openclaw
```
